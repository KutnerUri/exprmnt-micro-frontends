# Duda Micro-frontends assignments

## Goal:

1. Create an app with micro frontends
2. The app will show an online store, composed of a host app ("the store"), a product gallery (micro app 1), and a cart (micro app 2).
3. The host app will own a shared state, where the two sub apps communicate through.
