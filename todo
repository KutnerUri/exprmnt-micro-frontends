# Duda Micro-frontends assignments

## Goal:

1. Create an app with micro frontends
2. The app will show an online store, composed of a host app ("the store"), a product gallery (micro app 1), and a cart (micro app 2).
3. The host app will own a shared state, where the two sub apps communicate through.

## Todo

- [x] orchestrator
  - [x] build jsx
  - [x] tests

  - [x] hard-coded blueprint
  - [x] hard-coded plugins

  - [x] mock data (images, text, prices)
  - [x] basic implementation
- [x] gallery plugin
  - [x] mock data (images, text, prices)
  - [x] gallery slot
- [x] mfe elements
- [x] cart context
  - [x] top level context for the app

  - [ ] gallery api (mocks)
- [ ] dynamic imports
  - [ ] lazy loading

## Reference

### Entities

- item
  - price, name, id, (quantity)

### Cart

The cart shows a list of added items.
The cart has two views: list view, and button view. (maybe even full page view)

- remove item(s) from cart
- total price

### Gallery

Shows a grid of items

- add item to cart, increase quantity
- remove (added) item

### ideas:

- each sub-app should be dynamic, so that we could swap them for a different implementation, or turned off completely
- pages? (discovery page with the gallery, review page with cart alone, purchase page, etc)
- (bonus) retractable cart
- (bonus) error boundary and loader for the apps
